# Introduction

CensorCore is a flexible and configurable framework for censoring images based on the NudeNet ML model. CensorCore is designed to be as flexible as possible and should be able to be integrated and adapted for any project that requires classifying or censoring images.

> This project is an extremely early preview and should be treated as such! The API is likely change, not all functionality is available and stability is not-exactly-top-notch.

To be honest, this project was just borne out of having a few different ideas of ways to use NudeNet and the idea of redoing all the tedious AI work every time was horrifying.
